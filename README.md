# VaxiCode
A program for a medical clinic has to keep track of patientsâ€™ records related to vaccination history.
Vaccination comes into two doses that can be taken at different clinics. The second dose must be taken at least 4 weeks
after the first dose. However the patient must take the second dose within 52 weeks of taking the first dose,
otherwise the patient must repeat the first dose.
